Hello! Welcome to my webpage!

This was created for D280 at Western Governor's University. Finished on 25.03.2024.

I used several pages of the Angular.io to learn how to write the code for the project as well as W3schools.

I used the WorldBank API for the database referenced (as instructed to by the project and the instructor). I also used the recommended svg file.

Nothing is quotes, paraphased, or summarized from any other sources. All code here is written by me (with my sweat, blood, and tears).
Some inspiration was of course taken from the Angular.io, but no code was copied from anywhere.

I hope you enjoy my webpage and my creative code.

Thank you!
